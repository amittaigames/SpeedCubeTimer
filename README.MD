# SpeedCubeTimer

### What is it?

A timer to speed cubers with a low budget ;)

### How do I use it?

Just like any other speed cube timer. Press and hold on the space bar
to prime the timer, and let go to begin. Once you hit the space
bar again, it will stop the timer, showing you your speed. If your
speed is better than your saved best, it will update. You can
rinse and repeat as many times as you'd like.
